# ðŸš— Parking Service API â€“ Demo Setup & Usage

This project simulates a **smart parking garage system** with live API endpoints, terminal feedback, and a visual dashboard.  
Itâ€™s designed for **demo purposes and client presentations**.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Demo

### 1. Start the backend server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

- Runs FastAPI server at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000]
- Mounts dashboard (if present) at `/static`  
- Initializes cache and logs startup events  

---

### 2. Run the simulation script

```bash
python simulate_apict.py
```

- Simulates **vehicle entries and exits** with randomized data  
- Interacts with **API endpoints** to mimic real garage behavior  
- Displays **occupancy, active vehicles, and exit logs** in terminal  

---

## ðŸ“Š Visual Dashboard

Open in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html
http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/indexVue.html
http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/dashboard.html

```

### Features
- ðŸŸ¢ **Donut chart** â€“ occupancy (free vs occupied)  
- ðŸ“Š **Bar chart** â€“ daily revenue  
- ðŸš˜ **Bar chart** â€“ vehicle type distribution  
- ðŸ“‹ **Live table** â€“ active parked vehicles (auto-refresh every 10s)

## ðŸ”Œ API Endpoints Overview

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                               |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/vehicles/enter`        | Register vehicle entry, returns barcode    |
| POST   | `/vehicles/exit/{barcode}` | Process exit, calculate duration & revenue |
| GET    | `/occupancy`             | Show total capacity and current occupancy  |
| GET    | `/spaces/free`           | Return number of free parking spaces       |
| GET    | `/vehicles/active`       | List all currently parked vehicles         |
| GET    | `/revenue/today`         | Return total revenue for the current day   |
| GET    | `/health`                | Check service status                       |

## ðŸ§ª Notes

- All data is **in-memory** and resets on server restart  
- Simulation generates **random Serbian-style license plates**  
- Dashboard **Refresh after click on button** for live feedback
